<h1> Sinking of Moskva </h1>

 <div class="city">
    <h2>Fate of the russian flagship Moskva</h2>
	<p> Background, in February 2022, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the guided missile cruiser Moskva, 
	left Sevastopol to participate in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
	<br>The ship was used against the Ukrainian armed forces during the attack on Snake Island. Moskva hailed the island's garrison over the radio and demanded its surrender, 
	receiving the now-famous reply "Russian warship, go fuck yourself" from its garrison. 
	After this, all contact was lost with Snake Island, and the thirteen-member Ukrainian garrison was captured.
	<br>
	<br> The ship was about 65 nmi (120 km) south of Odesa when she was struck by two R-360 Neptune anti-ship missiles.
	<br> The Ukrainian missiles were apparently fired from a land-based launcher near Odesa.
	<br> Casualties are still a bit unclear, but it seems that around half of the ship´s 500 crew survived.
	<br> The sinking of Moskva is the most costly single loss for the Russian military in the war to date, and the ship would cost around US$750 million to replace.
	<br> Although Russia did not confirm that Ukrainian missiles had hit the ship, in the morning of 15 April,
	<br>Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv, where the Neptune missiles allegedly used in the attack were designed and manufactured.

    <h2>Situation on April 14</h2>
<h4>Eastern Ukraine</h4> 
<br> <p>
Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas.
<br>
The Ukrainian General Staff reported on April 14 that elements of Russia’s 2nd Combined Arms Army—which was previously withdrawn from the Chernihiv axis—are deploying around Severodonetsk.
<br>This is the first Russian unit withdrawn from fighting in northeastern Ukraine to be recommitted to eastern Ukraine. 
<br>These units likely remain degraded, and Russian forces will face challenges integrating units from several military districts into a cohesive fighting force.
<br>Russian forces continued unsuccessful daily attacks against Rubizhne, Popasna, and Marinka and did not make any territorial advances on April 14.
<br>The UK Ministry of Defense reported on April 14 that Russian forces in eastern Ukraine are employing “massive rocket and artillery strikes,”.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Kharkiv and Izyum</h4>
<br>
Russian objective: Advance southeast to support Russian operations in Luhansk Oblast, and fix Ukrainian forces around Kharkiv in place.
<br>
Ukrainian Special Forces destroyed a bridge near Izyum while a Russian military convoy was crossing it on April 13.
<br>Ukrainian Special Forces are likely successfully interdicting Russian operations to reinforce the Izyum axis. 
<br>Russian forces launched limited attacks around Izyum in the last 24 hours but did not make any territorial advances.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Southern axis</h4>
<br>
Russian objective: Defend Kherson against Ukrainian counterattacks.
<br>
Fighting continued west of Kherson city on April 14.
<br>Russian forces conducted minor attacks against Ukrainian positions in Oleksandrivka, 30 km west of Kherson city.
<br>Ukrainian forces have destroyed a Russian supply depot in Kherson on April 13. 
<br>Heavy Ukrainian shelling of the Choronbaivka airfield.
<br>Ukrainian partisans have been active in the Melitopol region since at least mid-March. 
<br>
<br>
<h4>Sumy and northeastern Ukraine</h4>
<br>
Russian forces continued to redeploy from Belarus to Russia for further deployment to eastern Ukraine. 
<br>Elements of the 36th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District are likely redeploying from Gomel Oblast, Belarus, to western Russian Oblasts.
<br>Commercial satellite imagery taken on April 12 confirmed that Russian aircraft have predominantly departed Belarusian airfields for likely redeployment 
to the Izyum axis or eastern Ukraine.
