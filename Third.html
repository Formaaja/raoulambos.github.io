	<h1> Kharkiv counter-offensive </h1>
   <p>The Ukrainian eastern counteroffensive is an ongoing counteroffensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv Oblast, Donetsk Oblast, and Luhansk Oblast.
   <br> On 29 August, Ukraine announced it would soon launch an offensive in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine. 
   <br>Ukrainian units attacked soon after, and Russia's attention shifted to its Kherson line. 
   <br>While the Kherson offensive might be genuine, Western analysts view it as part of a ploy to divert Russian forces away from Kharkiv prior to Ukraine's much larger eastern counteroffensive. 
   <br>In any case, Russian forces in Kharkiv were left understrength and unprepared in the days preceding 6 September.
   <br>
   <br>The Ukrainian eastern counteroffensive was launched on 6 September 2022.
   <br> The arrival of US-supplied HIMARS guided rocket artillery enabled Ukrainian forces to strike 70 kilometers behind Russian lines, 
   <br>targeting Russian bases and ammunition depots as far back as Kupiansk and Kivsharivka. 
   <br>These strikes further weakened Russian logistics and morale.

    <h3>September 6-12</h3>
   <p> 6 September, having concentrated their forces north of Balakliia at Pryshyb, a small village about 15 km northwest of Balakliia. 
   <br>Ukrainian troops launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast, which drove Russian forces back to the left bank of the Donets and Serednya Balakliika rivers.
	<br>The Ukrainian forces involved are Ukrainian special forces, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and troops from the 92nd Mechanised Brigade.
	<br>
	<br>8 September, Ukrainian troops had advanced 50 kilometres deep into Russian defensive positions north of Izium. 
	<br>SOBR units of Russian National Guard forces lost control of Balakliia, about 44 km northwest of Izium,
	<br>although Ukraine did not establish control of the city until 10 September.
	<br>Near the city, Ukrainian forces recaptured the largest ammunition storage base of the Central Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
	<br>Ukrainian forces also regained control over more than 20 settlements.
	<br>Ukrainian forces captured a high-ranking Russian officer on the Kharkiv front.
	<br>
	<br>9 September, Ukrainian forces reached Kupiansk, a vital transit hub at the junction of several of the main railway lines supplying Russian troops at the front.
	<br>In response to the Ukrainian advance, Russian reserve units were sent as reinforcements to both Kupiansk and Izium.
	<br> 
	<br>10 September, Ukrainian forces retook Kupiansk and Izium, and were reportedly advancing towards Lyman.
	<br>
	<br>11 September, Ukrainian forces have penetrated Russian lines to a depth of up to 70 kilometers in some places and retaken more than 3,000 square kilometers of territory since September 6.
	<br>
	<br>Russia had lost at least 338 pieces of military hardware in the five days to 11 September. 
	<br>This included fighter jets, tanks and trucks that had been destroyed, damaged or captured
