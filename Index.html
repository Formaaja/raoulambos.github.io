    <h2>Prelude to this conflict</h2>
   <p>In March and April 2021, the Russian Armed Forces began massing thousands of personnel and military equipment near Russia's border with Ukraine and in Crimea, 
   <br>representing the largest mobilization since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.
   <br> This precipitated an international crisis due to concerns over a potential invasion. Satellite imagery showed movements of armour, missiles, and heavy weaponry. 
   <br>The troops were partially withdrawn by June 2021, though the infrastructure was left in place. 
   <br>A second build-up began in October 2021, this time with more soldiers and with deployments on new fronts.
   <br>By December over 100,000 Russian troops were massed around Ukraine on three sides, including Belarus from the north and Crimea from the south.
	<br> On the morning of 24 February, Putin announced that Russia was initiating a "special military operation" in the Donbas, and launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.</p>

    <h3>Russias equipment</h3>
   <p>I took these numbers from wikipedia so take them with a huge grain of salt. 
   <br>It is impossible to know in which state most of the older soviet era equipment.
   Russian stockpiles are also notoriously inflated due to corruption and the sheer size that was the Soviet Union.
   <br> about more modern equipment i am able to give a better opinion, due to my personal experience studying and researching on Russian military equipment. 
   <br> Tanks: Russians have around 9000 T-72 MBTs in stockpile and this vehicle was the backbone of the Soviet union during the cold war.
   The main problems of T-72 are a weak gun by modern standards, insufficient armour, outdated night vision system, small gun lifting angle. But the main problem is bad placement of ammunition. 
   That is why in most cases when the armor in T-72 is damaged, the tank “loses its head”, clear thing, together with the crew.
   <br>Around 3400 T-80 MBTs, it´s main issues are in too high fuel consumption and constant maintenance issues. 
   <br>600 T-90, this model was for a long time praised as one of the best MBT in the world, however during this conflict it´s main weakness has been revealed.
   Modern anti-tank weapons are not hitting its strong sides or front, instead these relatively cheap missiles hit the top of the tank, and destroying it this way.
   <br> Artillery: Russias greatest advantage. 
   <br>Even with inflated numbers and poor training, artillery can and usually will dominate the battlefield.
   <br> There is nothing that special about Russian artillery, accuracy has not been ideal (probably due to old equipment and ammunition), but with the way Russia is waging this war, 
   it really does not matter for them. If and when Russia has been able to advance it is thanks to a 3:1 artillery ratio, usually even greater resulting in complete overpower.
   As we have seen it translates to a really slow advance. Russia uses around 20,000 shells a day, compared to Ukraines 6 000.
   <br>
   <br> Multipurpose fighters: Russia has around 100 each of Mig 29 and 31, Sukhoi 27, 30, 35 and around 140 of Sukhoi 34. 
   <br> Attack-aircraft and bombers: 270 Sukhoi SU-24 and 190 SU-25, in addition to 66 Tupolev TU-22M, 42 TU-95 and 15 TU-160.
   <br> It is purely thanks to Russias airforces failure to destroy Ukraine’s mobile SAM systems at the start of the war, that Russia remains unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy 
   and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing bomber and multi-role fighter fleets to bombard Ukrainian strategic targets and frontline positions from medium altitude, as it did in Syria. 
   <br> Without air superiority, Russia’s attempts at strategic air attack have been limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages at a much more limited scale. 
   <br>These failed to achieve strategically decisive damage during the first seven months of the invasion. 
   However, the latest iteration is a more focused and sustainable bombardment of the Ukrainian electricity grid, 
   blending hundreds of cheap Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 loitering munitions against substations with continued use of cruise and ballistic missiles against larger targets.

 <h3> January 2022</h3>
 <p> Russia began a slow evacuation of its embassy staff at Kyiv beginning in January 2022.  
 <br>By mid-January, an intelligence assessment produced by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence estimated that 
 Russia was in its final stages of completing a military buildup at the Russo-Ukrainian border, amassing 127,000 troops at the region. 
 <br>The assessment estimated that Russia had deployed 36 Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) systems near the border, many stationed within striking distance of Kyiv. 
 <br>The assessment also reported intensified Russian intelligence activity.
 <br>Ukrainian and American officials believed that Russia would attempt to use Belarus as a platform to attack Ukraine from the north, due to the close proximity of the Belarusian–Ukrainian border to the city of Kyiv.
 <br> On 20 January 2022, Russia announced plans to hold major naval drills later that month that would involve all of its naval fleets: 
140 vessels, 60 planes, 1,000 units of military hardware, and 10,000 soldiers, in the Mediterranean, the northeast Atlantic Ocean, 
the Pacific, the North Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk.
<br>In an interview with The Washington Post in January 2022, Zelenskyy warned that
 Russian forces could invade and take control of regions in eastern Ukraine. </p>

    <h2>Russian ground forces are advancing on four primary axes, February 25</h2>
   <p>Kyiv (North):
<br>
<br>
Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on the west bank of the Dnipro on February 25. Russian forces have so far failed to enter Kyiv’s eastern outskirts. 
They have abandoned for now the failed attempt to take the city of Chernihiv and are instead bypassing it.
<br>
<br>
Northeast front, also known as Kharkiv front:
<br>
<br>
Russian forces will likely envelop Kharkiv in the next 24 hours after failing to enter the city through frontal assaults on February 24. 
<br> Russian forces are now advancing on a broad front along the northeastern Ukrainian border as of February 25.
<br> Russian forces have reportedly crossed the northeastern Ukrainian border at several other points both west of Kharkiv, including Okhtyrka and Sumy.
<br> Russian forces are likely advancing toward Kyiv on a broad front and may seek to envelop and isolate Kharkiv.
<br>
<br>
Donbas (East):
<br>
<br>
Russian forces have achieved little success on the frontal assaults or the envelopment but may not have intended to do more than pin Ukrainian forces in the east. 
<br> The Russians have not weighted their ground offensive efforts toward breaking through Ukrainian defensive positions on the line of contact, 
taking Mariupol from the east, or driving rapidly through Luhansk Oblast to the north. 
<br> Ukrainian forces remain largely in their original defensive positions in the east. 
<br>The Russians may be content to leave them there while concentrating on capturing Kyiv and imposing a new government on Ukraine. 
<br>They may alternatively seek to envelop and destroy Ukrainian forces at and near the line of contact at a later date.
<br>
<br>
Crimea-Kherson (South):
<br>
<br>
Russian forces fully captured Kherson and are likely on the verge of seizing Melitopol in the east.
Unconfirmed reports indicate that Russian forces had bypassed Kherson earlier and headed directly for Mykolaiv and Odessa.
<br>
<br> Final notes:
<br> Russian Naval Infantry have not yet conducted amphibious landings but retain the capability to do so against the Odesa or the Azov Sea coasts or both.
<br> Russian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. 
<br> The Ukrainian air force also remains active. 
<br> Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities and eventually take the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.

    <h2>Russian ground forces are advancing on four primary axes, February 27</h2>
   <p>Kyiv:
   <br>
   <br> Russian forces likely conducted an operational pause on the Kyiv axis on February 26-27 to deploy additional supplies and forces forward. 
   <br>Russian forces will likely resume offensive operations against Kyiv in the next 24 hours. 
   Russian forces committed additional reserves to fighting west of Kyiv. 
   <br>Russian troops have not yet committed heavy armor and artillery forces to fighting in Kyiv and will likely need to do so to take the city. Ukrainian forces are unlikely to capitulate.
<br>
<br>
Northeast front:
<br>
<br> Russian forces largely conducted an operational pause on their current broad front of advance between Chernihiv and Kharkiv. 
<br>Russian forces entered the city of Kharkiv for the first time on February 27 but remain unlikely to take the city without the use of heavier firepower. 
<br>Ukrainian forces continue to delay and inflict losses on the Russian advance but will likely not be able to halt further advances if the Kremlin commits additional reserves.
<br>
<br>
Donbas:
<br>
<br> Russian forces have encircled Mariupol from the west and began initial assaults on the city. 
<br> Russian forces have not made any major territorial gains from the east in Donbas after four days of fighting. 
<br> Russian forces likely intend to pin Ukrainian forces in place on the line of contact to enable Russian forces breaking out of Crimea to isolate them. 
<br> The Russians may be content to leave them there while concentrating on capturing Kyiv and imposing a new government on Ukraine. 
<br> They may alternatively seek to encircle and destroy them or force them to surrender.
<br>
<br>
Crimea-Kherson:
<br>
<br> Russian forces continued to advance north towards Zaprozhia and threaten to isolate Ukrainian forces on the line of contact in Donbas if they do not withdraw. 
<br> Russian forces failed to seize Kherson after Ukrainian counterattacks reclaimed it on February 26. 
<br> An unknown concentration of Russian forces remains on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River and threatens Mikolayiv, however.
